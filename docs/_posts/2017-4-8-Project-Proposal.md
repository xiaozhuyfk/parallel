### Title
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask Me Anything: Parallel Question Answering System with Freebase


### Team

### Summary


### Background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freebase is a large collaborative knowledge base containing well structured data that allows machines to access them efficiently. Each entity can be considered as a graph node in the Freebase knowledge graph, and each outward edge together with the connecting entity or attribute represents a piece of fact or knowledge that could be used to answer different kinds of questions.
