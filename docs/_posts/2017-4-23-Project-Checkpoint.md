## CURRENT STATUS & FUTURE SCHEDULE

| Date       | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2017.04.10 | Pre-process Freebase data, split and load into multiple databases. Finalize the Question Answering system structure: entity recognition, query candidate expansion, ranking ... |
| 2017.04.17 | Train the Bi-diretional LSTM model on the Webquestions dataset in order to compute sentence similarity. Continue working on building the Question Answering system.             |
| 2017.04.24 | Test current system with example question set. Try different parallel techniques to speedup.                                                                                    |
| 2017.05.01 | Launch the Question Answering system on AWS. Try to build the web service to receive Question-Answering request.                                                                |
| 2017.05.08 | Finalize report and presentation. Continue working on web service and Question-Answering visualizer.                                                                            |
