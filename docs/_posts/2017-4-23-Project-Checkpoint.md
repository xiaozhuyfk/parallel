This document is a checkpoint review of our **Distributed Question Answering System** project for the course **15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming**, and we will cover the following topics in this report:
* Current Status and Future Schedule
* Summary of Work
* Preliminary Results
* Concerns

## CURRENT STATUS & FUTURE SCHEDULE

The following table shows the current status of our project, and the schedule for the future two weeks segmented into half-week periods.

| Date       | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                      | Status |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 2017.04.10 | Pre-process Freebase data, split and load into multiple databases. Finalize the Question Answering system structure: entity recognition, query candidate expansion, ranking ... | Done   |
| 2017.04.17 | Train the Bi-diretional LSTM model on the Webquestions dataset in order to compute sentence similarity. Continue working on building the Question Answering system.             | Done   |
| 2017.04.24 | Start working on AMA web service. Distribute computation of each fact candidate to multiple worker nodes.                                                                       |        |
|            | Start working on implementing parallel SVM.                                                                                                                                     |        |
| 2017.05.01 | Finalize implementation of the parallel version of SVM.                                                                                                                         |        |
|            | Combine all components and set up web service.                                                                                                                                  |        |
| 2017.05.08 | Finalize report and presentation. Start working on web service and Question-Answering visualizer if we have time.                                                               |        |
